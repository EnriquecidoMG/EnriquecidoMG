## Hi there 👋🏻
Hi! I'm **Enrique**, a passionate programmer with experience in _HTML, Godot, C#, GIMP, and more._ I love tackling everyday challenges with code and am constantly looking for new ways to enhance my skills and discover more efficient solutions. In my free time, I enjoy coding, listening to rock music, playing sports, and watching documentaries about monkeys. 🐵
